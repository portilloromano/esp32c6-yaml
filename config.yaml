# Example configuration for ESP32 Matter device endpoints and clusters.
# This file allows for dynamic configuration of the device's functionality,
# similar to ESPHome.
#
# Supported device_types:
#   - light
#
# Supported cluster names:
#   - on_off
#   - level_control
#   - color_control
#
# Attribute types and defaults will be handled by the application code
# based on the cluster name.

endpoints:
  - id: 1
    device_type: "light"
    clusters:
      - name: "on_off"
      - name: "level_control"

  # You can add more endpoints here. For example, a second light:
  # - id: 2
  #   device_type: "light"
  #   clusters:
  #     - name: "on_off"
